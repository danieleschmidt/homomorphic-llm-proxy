# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Homomorphic LLM Proxy is designed as a privacy-preserving gateway that enables secure LLM inference without exposing plaintext data to untrusted cloud infrastructure.

```

### Data Flow

1. **Encryption Phase**
   - Client generates CKKS encryption keys
   - Plaintext prompt encoded into polynomial representation
   - Ciphertext transmitted over TLS to proxy

2. **Processing Phase**
   - Proxy validates encryption parameters
   - Privacy budget checked and allocated
   - Homomorphic operations performed on GPU
   - Encrypted data forwarded to LLM provider

3. **Response Phase**
   - Encrypted response received from provider
   - Optional caching of encrypted responses
   - Streaming decryption for real-time output
   - Privacy budget updated

### Security Architecture

#### Threat Model
- **Assumptions**: Client and key storage are trusted
- **Adversary**: Honest-but-curious cloud provider
- **Guarantees**: Computational indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack

#### Key Management

    D --> F
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### GPU Acceleration
- Custom CUDA kernels for polynomial arithmetic
- Batched operations for throughput optimization
- Memory-mapped I/O for large ciphertexts

#### Caching Strategy

- Key rotation with graceful degradation
- LRU eviction for memory management

### Scalability Design

#### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless proxy design enables load balancing
- Session affinity for stream consistency
- Distributed key storage with Redis cluster

#### Resource Management
- GPU memory pooling across requests
- Dynamic batch sizing based on load
- Circuit breaker for overload protection
