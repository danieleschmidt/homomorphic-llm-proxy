# Security Architecture

This document describes the comprehensive security architecture and threat model for the Homomorphic LLM Proxy.

## Security Objectives

### Primary Security Goals
1. **Confidentiality**: Protect plaintext data from unauthorized access
2. **Integrity**: Ensure data hasn't been tampered with during processing
3. **Availability**: Maintain service availability under attack
4. **Privacy**: Prevent inference attacks on user data
5. **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

### Threat Model

#### Assumptions
- **Trusted Components**: Client applications, key management systems
- **Semi-Trusted**: Proxy server (honest-but-curious)
- **Untrusted**: Cloud infrastructure, network, LLM providers
- **Adversary Model**: Computationally bounded, passive eavesdropping, active attacks on network

#### Protected Assets
- User prompts and responses
- Encryption keys
- Privacy budget information
- System configurations
- Business logic

## Cryptographic Architecture

### Homomorphic Encryption Scheme
```
Primary Scheme: CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song)
- Security Level: 128-bit minimum
- Ring Dimension: 16384 (configurable)
- Modulus Chain: Optimized for depth and precision
- Noise Management: Bootstrapping when necessary
```

### Key Management

    A[Master Key] --> B[Encryption Keys]
    A --> C[Evaluation Keys]
    A --> D[Relinearization Keys]
    
    B --> E[Client Storage]
    C --> F[Proxy Cache]
    D --> F
    
    G[Key Rotation] --> A
    H[HSM/KMS] --> A
```

#### Key Lifecycle
1. **Generation**: Cryptographically secure random generation
2. **Distribution**: Secure channel establishment
3. **Storage**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) or cloud KMS
4. **Rotation**: Automated 24-hour rotation cycle
5. **Revocation**: Immediate invalidation on compromise

### Cryptographic Protocols

#### Client-Proxy Protocol
```
1. Key Exchange:
   Client → Proxy: ECDH key establishment
   Proxy → Client: Session parameters

2. Encryption:
   Client: plaintext → CKKS(plaintext, public_key)
   Client → Proxy: encrypted_prompt

3. Processing:
   Proxy: homomorphic_operations(encrypted_prompt)
   Proxy → LLM: encrypted_data

4. Response:
   LLM → Proxy: encrypted_response
   Proxy → Client: encrypted_response
   Client: CKKS_decrypt(encrypted_response, private_key)
```

#### Privacy Budget Protocol
```
1. Budget Allocation:
   ε_total = 10.0 (configurable)
   ε_per_query = 0.1 (adaptive)

2. Budget Tracking:
   current_budget = ε_total - Σ(ε_consumed)
   
3. Query Authorization:
   if (ε_query ≤ current_budget):
       authorize_query()
   else:
       reject_query()
```

## Security Controls

### Access Controls
