# Autonomous SDLC Enhancement System

## Overview

This repository has been enhanced with an autonomous Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) system that continuously discovers, prioritizes, and addresses the highest-value technical work items.

## Repository Maturity Assessment

**Current Level**: MATURING (65/100)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation structure
- ✅ Security practices (SBOM, SLSA provenance)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure configuration
- ✅ Container and Kubernetes deployment ready
- ❌ Core functionality implementation incomplete
- ❌ GitHub Actions workflows missing
- ❌ Monitoring and observability not integrated

## Value Discovery System

### Continuous Analysis Sources
- **Code Analysis**: TODO/FIXME markers, complexity hotspots
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection, dependency audits
- **Performance Monitoring**: Benchmark results, regression detection
- **Test Coverage**: Gap analysis and quality metrics
- **Documentation**: Drift detection and completeness analysis

### Scoring Framework

**WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) - 60% weight**
```
CostOfDelay = UserBusinessValue + TimeCriticality + RiskReduction + OpportunityEnablement
WSJF = CostOfDelay / JobSize
```

**ICE (Impact-Confidence-Ease) - 10% weight**
```
ICE = Impact × Confidence × Ease
```

**Technical Debt Assessment - 20% weight**  
```
TechnicalDebtScore = (DebtImpact + DebtInterest) × HotspotMultiplier
```

**Security Priority Boost - 10% weight**
- 2.0x multiplier for security vulnerabilities
- 1.8x multiplier for compliance issues

### Current Technical Debt Portfolio

**23 items discovered, 312 total estimated hours**

**Critical Blockers (Immediate Action Required)**:
1. **Complete FHE Implementation** - Core functionality missing (80h, Score: 50)
2. **HTTP Server Implementation** - API layer missing (40h, Score: 45)  
3. **GPU Integration** - Performance differentiator (60h, Score: 40)
4. **Input Validation** - Security vulnerability (16h, Score: 32)
5. **Privacy Budget Tracking** - Core privacy feature (32h, Score: 32)

## Autonomous Execution Protocol

### Task Selection Algorithm
1. Calculate composite scores for all discovered items
2. Apply strategic filters (dependencies, risk, conflicts)
3. Select highest-value executable task
4. Create feature branch: `auto-value/{item-id}-{slug}`
5. Execute changes with comprehensive validation
6. Generate detailed PR with value metrics

### Quality Gates
- ✅ All tests must pass
- ✅ Security scans must clear
- ✅ Performance regressions < 5%
- ✅ Code coverage maintained ≥ 80%
- ✅ Documentation updated

### Rollback Triggers
- Test failures
- Build failures  
- Security violations
- Performance degradation > 5%

## Configuration Files

## Continuous Learning

The system continuously learns from execution outcomes:
- **Estimation Accuracy**: Compare predicted vs actual effort
- **Impact Assessment**: Measure actual business value delivered
- **Risk Evaluation**: Track rollback frequency and causes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify similar tasks for better prediction

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Value Discovery Alerts
- New high-priority technical debt discovered
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Performance regressions identified
- Documentation drift from code changes

### Execution Monitoring
