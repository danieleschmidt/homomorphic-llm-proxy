## Privacy Framework

### Differential Privacy Implementation

**Mathematical Framework**
```
ε-differential privacy guarantee:
For all datasets D₁, D₂ differing by one record:
P[M(D₁) ∈ S] ≤ exp(ε) × P[M(D₂) ∈ S]

Privacy Budget Management:
- Total Budget: ε_total = 10.0
- Per-Query Budget: ε_query = 0.1 (adaptive)
- Composition: Sequential composition theorem
```

**Privacy Budget Tracking**
```python
class PrivacyBudget:
    def __init__(self, total_epsilon=10.0):
        self.total_epsilon = total_epsilon
        self.consumed_epsilon = 0.0
    
    def can_query(self, epsilon_cost):
        return (self.consumed_epsilon + epsilon_cost) <= self.total_epsilon
    
    def consume_budget(self, epsilon_cost):
        if self.can_query(epsilon_cost):
            self.consumed_epsilon += epsilon_cost
            return True
        return False
```

### Data Minimization Principles

**Use Limitation**

**Quality Assurance**
- Data accuracy through validation
- Completeness verification
- Currency through real-time processing
