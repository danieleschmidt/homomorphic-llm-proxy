# Autonomous Value Discovery System

## Overview

This document describes the continuous value discovery system implemented for autonomous SDLC enhancement.

## Value Scoring Framework

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
- **User Business Value**: Impact on users and business objectives
- **Time Criticality**: Urgency and deadline sensitivity  
- **Risk Reduction**: Mitigation of technical and business risks
- **Opportunity Enablement**: Future capabilities unlocked

### ICE Scoring
- **Impact**: Business and technical impact (1-10)
- **Confidence**: Execution confidence level (1-10)
- **Ease**: Implementation complexity (1-10, higher = easier)

### Technical Debt Assessment
- **Debt Impact**: Maintenance hours saved by addressing debt
- **Debt Interest**: Future cost growth if not addressed
- **Hotspot Multiplier**: Activity-complexity correlation (1-5x)

## Discovery Sources

### Code Analysis
```bash
# Scan for technical debt markers
rg "TODO|FIXME|HACK|DEPRECATED" --type rust
rg "XXX|BUG|WORKAROUND" --type rust

# Complexity analysis
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Vulnerability detection
cargo audit
trivy fs .

# Dependency analysis
cargo outdated
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Performance regression detection
cargo bench --features gpu
cargo flamegraph
```

## Execution Protocol

### Task Selection Algorithm
1. Calculate composite scores for all discovered items
2. Apply strategic filters (dependencies, risk, conflicts)
3. Select highest-value executable task
4. Create feature branch: `auto-value/{item-id}-{slug}`
5. Execute changes with comprehensive validation
6. Generate detailed PR with value metrics

### Continuous Learning
- Track actual vs predicted impact
- Adjust scoring weights based on outcomes
- Improve estimation accuracy over time
- Build pattern recognition for similar tasks

## Value Tracking

All value metrics are stored in `.terragon/value-metrics.json`:
- Execution history with impact measurements
- Backlog trends and velocity metrics
- Discovery effectiveness by source
- ROI calculations and value delivery

## Integration Points

- **GitHub Issues**: Import and prioritize existing issues
- **Security Alerts**: Boost priority for vulnerability fixes
- **Performance Monitoring**: React to regression alerts
- **Code Review**: Learn from review feedback patterns

This system ensures continuous, data-driven improvement of the repository's SDLC maturity and operational excellence.
