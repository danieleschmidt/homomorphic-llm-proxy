# Workflow Requirements

This document outlines the CI/CD workflows that should be implemented for this project.

## Required GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests
- **Jobs**: lint, test, build
- **Requirements**: 
  * Python 3.8+ matrix testing
  * Pre-commit hooks validation
  * Code coverage reporting

### 2. Code Quality (.github/workflows/quality.yml)
- **Triggers**: Pull requests
- **Jobs**: security scan, dependency check
- **Requirements**:
  * Ruff linting
  * Safety security checks
  * Dependency vulnerability scanning

### 3. Documentation (.github/workflows/docs.yml)
- **Triggers**: Main branch changes
- **Jobs**: build and deploy docs
- **Requirements**: Automated documentation deployment

## Manual Setup Required

⚠️ **These workflows require manual creation due to repository permissions:**

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Add workflow YAML files (see [GitHub Actions Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions))
3. Configure branch protection rules
4. Set up repository secrets for deployments

## Workflow Templates

Templates for these workflows are available in the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions).

## Branch Protection

Configure these settings manually in repository settings:
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks
- Restrict pushes to main branch
- Require branches to be up to date
