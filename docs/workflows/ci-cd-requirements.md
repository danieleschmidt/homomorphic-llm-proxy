      - name: Scan Python dependencies with safety
      - name: CodeQL analysis
      - name: Container image scanning
```

### 2. GPU Testing (`gpu-tests.yml`)

**Trigger Events:**
- Pull requests with 'gpu' label
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Requirements:**
- Self-hosted runner with NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA 12.0+ environment
- Docker with GPU support

**Jobs:**
```yaml
jobs:
  gpu-performance:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, gpu]
    steps:
      - name: Setup CUDA environment
      - name: Build with GPU features
      - name: Run GPU benchmarks
      - name: Performance regression analysis
      - name: Upload benchmark results
```

### 3. Release Automation (`release.yml`)

**Trigger Events:**
- Push of version tags (v*.*.*)

**Jobs:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build-artifacts:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    steps:
      - name: Build release binaries
      - name: Build Python wheels
      - name: Sign artifacts
      - name: Upload to release
  
  docker-release:
    steps:
      - name: Build multi-arch Docker images
      - name: Push to registry
      - name: Update latest tag
  
  publish-python:
    steps:
      - name: Publish to PyPI
      - name: Update documentation
```

### 4. Documentation (`docs.yml`)

**Trigger Events:**
- Push to main branch (docs/ changes)
- Pull requests (docs/ changes)

**Jobs:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build-docs:
    steps:
      - name: Build documentation
      - name: Check links
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages (main only)
      - name: Update API documentation
```

### 5. Dependency Updates (`dependabot-auto-merge.yml`)

**Trigger Events:**
- Dependabot pull requests

**Requirements:**
- Auto-merge for patch updates if tests pass
- Require review for minor/major updates
- Separate handling for security updates

## Security Requirements

### Secret Management
Required secrets in GitHub repository settings:

```yaml
secrets:
  CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN: # For crates.io publishing
  PYPI_API_TOKEN: # For PyPI publishing
  DOCKER_USERNAME: # For Docker Hub
  DOCKER_PASSWORD: # For Docker Hub
  GPG_PRIVATE_KEY: # For artifact signing
  GPG_PASSPHRASE: # For artifact signing
  BENCHMARK_WEBHOOK: # For performance tracking
```

### Security Policies
- All workflows must use pinned action versions
- No secrets in workflow logs
- Signed commits required for releases
- Two-person approval for security-related changes

## Performance Monitoring

### Benchmark Integration
- Automated performance regression detection
- Benchmark result storage and trending
- Alert on >10% performance degradation
- GPU memory usage monitoring

### Quality Gates
- Test coverage minimum: 85%
- Security scan: No high/critical vulnerabilities
- Performance: <5% regression tolerance
- Documentation: All public APIs documented

## Deployment Integration

### Staging Environment
- Automatic deployment on main branch updates
- Integration testing with real LLM providers
- Privacy budget testing
- Load testing scenarios

### Production Readiness
- Blue-green deployment support
- Rollback capability
- Health check integration
- Metrics collection

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Workflow Files
Create the following files in `.github/workflows/`:
- `ci.yml` - Continuous integration
- `gpu-tests.yml` - GPU-specific testing
- `release.yml` - Release automation
- `docs.yml` - Documentation building
- `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` - Dependency automation

### Step 2: Configure Runners
Set up self-hosted runners for:
- GPU testing (NVIDIA GPU required)
- Performance benchmarking
- Security scanning

### Step 3: Set Up Secrets
Configure all required secrets in repository settings under Actions â†’ Secrets.

### Step 4: Branch Protection
Configure branch protection rules:
- Require status checks for all jobs
- Require up-to-date branches
- Require signed commits
- Restrict push to main branch

### Step 5: Monitoring Integration
- Set up benchmark result collection
- Configure performance alerting
- Integrate with monitoring dashboard

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monthly review of workflow performance
- Quarterly security audit of workflows
- Update action versions quarterly
- Review and update quality gates

### Troubleshooting
- Monitor workflow execution times
- Check for flaky tests
- Verify secret rotation schedule
- Maintain runner infrastructure

## Compliance

### Audit Requirements
- All changes to workflows require security review
- Workflow execution logs retained for 90 days
- Performance metrics archived for 1 year
- Security scan results permanently archived

### Privacy Considerations
- No sensitive data in workflow logs
- Encrypted artifact storage
- Limited access to production secrets
- Privacy budget monitoring in CI
