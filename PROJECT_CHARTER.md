# Project Charter: Homomorphic LLM Proxy

## Executive Summary

The Homomorphic LLM Proxy is a privacy-preserving gateway that enables secure Large Language Model (LLM) inference without exposing plaintext data to untrusted cloud infrastructure. By leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), the system allows organizations to utilize powerful cloud-based LLMs while maintaining complete data privacy and regulatory compliance.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Privacy Concerns**: Organizations cannot use cloud LLMs with sensitive data due to privacy requirements
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations prevent cloud ML adoption
3. **Data Sovereignty**: Government and enterprise data cannot leave trusted environments
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Proprietary information risk when using third-party ML services

### Market Opportunity
- $50B+ cloud AI market with privacy as primary adoption barrier
- 70% of enterprises cite data privacy as top ML adoption concern
- Growing regulatory pressure for privacy-preserving AI solutions
- Limited viable alternatives for privacy-preserving LLM inference

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Core FHE Gateway**: CKKS-based encryption proxy for LLM APIs
- **Client SDKs**: Python, JavaScript, and REST API clients
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA-optimized homomorphic operations
- **Enterprise Features**: Multi-tenancy, audit logging, privacy budgets
- **Provider Integration**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, custom APIs
- **Deployment Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, cloud marketplace listings

### Out of Scope
- **Model Training**: Focus on inference only, not training
- **Custom LLM Development**: Integration, not model creation
- **General Purpose FHE**: Specialized for LLM use cases only
- **Mobile SDKs**: Server-to-server focus initially
